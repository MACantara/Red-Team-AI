## Game Mechanics

### Winning Conditions
- **Red Team Wins**: Successfully breach the system
- **Blue Team Wins**: Detect and neutralize the threat (detection > 4)

### System State Variables
- **Vulnerabilities**: Number of exploitable weaknesses (0-5, adaptive)
- **Detection Level**: Current threat detection capability (0-5)
- **Security Level**: Overall system security strength (0-10)
- **Network Activity**: Level of suspicious network traffic (0-5)
- **Breach Status**: Whether the system has been compromised
- **Logs Analyzed**: Whether security logs have been examined

### Scoring System
- Blue team gains points for successful threat neutralization
- Red team gains points for successful system breaches
- Performance statistics track long-term success rates

## Advanced Features

### Adaptive Difficulty System
- **Dynamic Vulnerabilities**: Base vulnerabilities increase as AI learns
  - Round 20+: Chance for 4 initial vulnerabilities
  - Round 50+: Chance for 5 initial vulnerabilities
- **Strategic Evolution**: AI strategies become more sophisticated over time
- **Balanced Challenge**: Detection mechanisms adapt to common attack patterns

### AI Strategy Selection
The Red Team AI dynamically chooses between three strategies:

1. **Stealth Mode** ü•∑
   - Activated when detection levels are high (>3)
   - Prefers low-detection actions (scan, social_engineering)
   - Minimizes risk of discovery

2. **Aggressive Mode** ‚öîÔ∏è
   - Activated when vulnerabilities are high and detection is low
   - Prefers high-reward actions (exploit, brute_force)
   - Maximizes damage potential

3. **Adaptive Mode** üß†
   - Default balanced approach
   - Switches between strategies based on context
   - Optimizes for long-term success

### Performance Analytics
- **Real-time Learning Progress**: Visual representation of AI improvement
- **Win Rate Tracking**: Long-term performance trends
- **Strategy Distribution**: Analysis of AI decision patterns
- **Speed Metrics**: Average round completion times
